This project focuses on analyzing the reach of Instagram content to gain insights into the performance of posts and overall account engagement. By leveraging Instagram's API, the application retrieves data related to post interactions, reach, and engagement metrics. The primary goal is to provide users with a comprehensive analysis of their Instagram reach, allowing them to make informed decisions to enhance their social media strategy.
